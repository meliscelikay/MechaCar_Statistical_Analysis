# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Project Overview
AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. The data analytics do following to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team:
- Identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. 

## Resources
- Dataset: [MechaCar_mpg.csv](), [Suspension_Coil.csv]()
- Software:  RStudio 2022.07.0+548

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Linear Regression to Predict MPG.png]()

1.Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

2.Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

3.Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
